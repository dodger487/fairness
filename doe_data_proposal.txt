# Data Request from NYC DoE for High School Application Process information.

## What are your research objectives and the purpose of the study?

The New York City Department of Education has a large challenge in efficiently and fairly placing students into high schools. To meet this challenge, the Department has used a large-scale matching algorithm which has been successful-- for example, 92% of students are matched and 85% are assigned to one of their top five choices. Although successful, the assignment process can be confusing to navigate, especially for students in underpriviliged circumstances. To best support these students, however, a data-driven analysis is required to understand if sub-optimal choices are being made and, if so, in what way and how to mitigate them.

The purpose of this study is to perform a data-driven analysis of the match in order to help support the assignment process for underprivileged or underrepresented communities. The first objective is to understand the similarities and differences in how different groups participate in the match, with an eye towards where groups can alter their behaviors to achieve better assignment results. This analysis will be compiled into a report that non-profits can use to help communicate with students entering into the assignment process who need additional support. A second objective is to study recent developments in computer science on balancing algorithms. These algorithms are processes that run on top of existing procedures (such as a matching algorithm) to improve results. The purpose here is to create an academic research paper that will analyze the impact of these algorithms in a real world setting. The results will be shared with the academic computer science community and with the Department of Education.


## What is your research hypothesis and methodology for this work? 

To conduct this research, we will need several pieces of information.
1. The rank lists and assignments of students who entered the High School Admissions Program. We do NOT require any personally identifiable information about students, but it would be helpful to have this data associated with an anonymous unique ID.
2. Biographic dataset files for the anonymous students.
3. If available, normalized information about the admissions criteria or requirements associated with each school.

Given this data, the researchers will test several hypotheses:
- Is there a difference between the length of rank lists for reduced/free lunch students non-free lunch students?
- Is there a difference in the distribution of school quality for the rank lists for reduced/free lunch students non-free lunch students?
- What is the impact of geography on rank lists? Do students apply to schools clustered in one area? Is there a difference in this between reduced/free lunch students non-free lunch students?

We will additionally adapt a balancing algorithm (see Dwork et al., Proceedings of the 3rd Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference. ACM, 2012.) and apply it to the match data. We will examine the impact on:
- Schools: what is the impact on the average rank of the students per school?
- Students: what is the impact on number of students matched and average rank of assignment?
This will give us an idea of global utility, and see if and by how much it might decrease with the use of this algorithm.

We will conduct this methodology by engaging in statistical analysis using data from the Department of Education.


## What is your timeline for this work? Please describe key research activities and an estimated completion date.

I believe the maximum amount of time required to conduct this work is two months.

- Processing, cleaning, and developing initial understanding of the data (such as descriptive statistics) will take approximately one week.
- Analyzing the average school quality of schools on the rank list by demographic group will take one week.
- Analyzing impact of geography upon rank lists should take two weeks. We will look at geographic clustering behaviors of rank lists, determining if these are different for different groups.
- The remainder of time (one month) will be spent on adapting and running a fairness algorithm on top of a matching algorithm.


## Please provide a brief statement of the risks and benefits of the research.

There are a variety of benefits to this work. We hope that our work could help inform the Department of Education, and non-profits on the behavior of students entering the High School Admissions Process. Our work should help show how students are making their decisions, which in turn could help the non-profits in their communication with students, parents, schools, and other stakeholders, helping New York City high schoolers in the important process of selecting a high school.

Given that this research does not require the use of personally identifiable information, and that no test subjects will be involved, we find there to be minimal risks.


## Please provide a description of how the data will be used and the intended audience(s) for the findings.

As described in the methodology section, we will use the data to answer the following questions:
- Is there a difference between the length of rank lists for reduced/free lunch students non-free lunch students?
- Is there a difference in the distribution of school quality for the rank lists for reduced/free lunch students non-free lunch students?
- What is the impact of geography on rank lists? Do students apply to schools clustered in one area? Is there a difference in this between reduced/free lunch students non-free lunch students?
- What is the impact of balancing algorithms on the result? What is the increase or decrease in global utility for all stakeholders, including students and schools?

The data will be analyzed using code custom-written by a computer science PhD student at Columbia University. This will produce a variety of graphs and summary statistics illustrating the results of our work.

There are three intended audiences for our findings. We would like to share our work with non-profits who support students preparing to be assigned to New York City high schools. Our results should help them better understand the behavior of applicants within the High School Admissions Process. We would also like to share any interesting findings with the Department of Education. If through our work on algorithmic balancing we obtain interesting results, we would like to share our results with the academic computer science community. This sharing will be done in the form of an academic paper which will not require the disclosure of any private data.


## You must provide a detailed description of the data security plan to ensure protection of student and employee information including but not limited to data encryption, security of the transmission process, and provisions to prevent unauthorized access.

We do not require personally identifiable information. All sensitive Department of Education data will be kept in an encrypted format on a computer located behind several locked doors in Columbia University. The data on this computer will only be accessible by me, who can log in using a password and private key. Security audits are regularly conducted by teams of experts at Columbia to insure that all computers (including the one that will be used) are not accessible by bad actors.

There are a variety of ways we can insure a secure transmission process. Being located in New York, we could provide a city government regulation compliant hard drive to physically move the data. Otherwise, the Columbia University Information Technology team has experience dealing with secure data transfers of this kind will assist.


## Please provide details on the data transmission including server address and log in credentials.

Upon this request being approved, we are happy to set up an FTP server with the help of Columbia University Information Technology, or to physically provide a hard drive to the DoE.


## Please provide an explicit timeline and description of how the data will be destroyed. 

We hope to present our work as an academic publication in the computer science community. After presenting our work, we would like to retain the data for a period of time in order to answer and analyze follow-up questions that our presentation may generate. Thus, we would like to keep the data for up to one year after publication. After this period of time, we will delete the data from the secure server at Columbia, using a secure deletion program such as the unix commands "shred" or "wipe".



## Please provide a general description of your data needs. You will be asked to explain in more detail in the following questions on this page.

To conduct this research, we will require two set of information.
1. The rank lists and assignments of students who entered the High School Admissions Program. We do NOT require any personally identifiable information about students, but it would be helpful to have this data associated with an anonymous unique ID.
2. Biographic dataset files for the anonymous students, associated with the aforementioned anonymous unique ID. In particular, a non-personally identifiable student tracking number associated with school identification number (DBN), gender, ethnicity, home language, status, ELL status, free or reducted lunch status, and attendance.

Additional data requests would help aid our analysis but are not completely necessary for our work.
3. (Optional) Anonymized home location data associated with the anonymous unique ID would additionally be useful (at a neighborhood or multiblock level) but is not necessary.
4. (Optional) If available, normalized information about the admissions criteria or requirements associated with each school.
5. (Optional) If available, outcome variables about students (such as grades, attendance, test scores, etc.) can be useful in determining the match effectiveness.
6. (Optional) Having all of these datasets for multiple years could help show how behaviors have changed over time (e.g. students may be improving in their matching behaviors).


## Years required
2005 - 2016

## Please provide an explanation for requesting data for these school years.
At a minimum, we need match data (as described in the previous question) for one year.

It would, however, be desirable to have data over several years to see if student ranking behavior has changed over time. For example, it might be interesting to have years 2005-2006, 2010-2011, and 2015-2016, analyzing if rank lists have change during these times.


## Please select the grade levels for which you want data.
7th grade - 12th grade


## Please select from the list below the data types you are requesting.
## Please provide an explanation for how each of the Data Types selected above supports your work.
We do *not* require all files listed above to have a successful project. At a minimum we would need the "Student Demographic Data".

Student Demographic Data would be used to associate rank list behavior with demographics, such as ethnicity, home language, birthplace, or ELL status.
Student Demographic Data would be used to associated rank list behavior with school attended (via school identification number), gender, ethnicity, home language, status, ELL status, free or reducted lunch status, and attendance.

Additional data would be used for the following:
* Student NY State Math and ELA data: used to see how student performance correlates with rank list behavior, or if some successful students in retrospect should have ranked more competitive schools higher..
* Student Regents: used to see how student performance correlates with rank list behavior, or if some successful students in retrospect should have ranked more competitive schools higher..
* Student Graduation: used to understand if certain ranking behaviors are associated with different outcomes, or if some successful students in retrospect should have ranked more competitive schools higher.
* Student Attendance: used to understand if certain ranking behaviors are associated with different outcomes, or if some successful students in retrospect should have ranked more competitive schools higher.
